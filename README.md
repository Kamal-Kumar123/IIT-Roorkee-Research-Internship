# IIT-Roorkee-Research-Internship
Here, I have uploaded some python codes that I build during research internship at IIT Roorkee.

Manual_Clustering: This file is used to manually verify the clustering results obtained using the K-Means algorithm. It ensures that the clustering is accurate or not. Both a Colab notebook and a Python script are provided, allowing users to directly run the code or apply it to their own data.

compare_excel_sheets: This script compares two Excel sheets with the same number of rows and columns. It is intended for use on datasets with identical structures, ensuring a meaningful comparison.
